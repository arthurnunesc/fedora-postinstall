# fedora-postinstall

This script was written to help me reinstall all the utilities, tools and programs I need after formatting my personal computers. 

As it is a very personal project, it is heavily focused on satisfaying my needs and isn't really extensible. All the new features that are needed are introduced directly into the code without any decoupling.

To run this script, use:
- `bash ./run.sh`
