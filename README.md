# iscreepchee
Pronounced like it is read, tries to mimic the way Brazilians pronounce the word "script".

This is a compilation of scripts written to help me install all my utilities, tools and programs plus their respective configs on the computers I have access to.

It detects if it is being executed on a Linux machine(personal computer) or a MacOS machine(42 School computer) and runs components accordingly(ie. if on a 42 computer, doesn't run any sudo commands or Linux specific scripts).

## usage

`./iscreepchee.sh "install and config"` to install and configure everything.

`./iscreepchee.sh config` to only configure everything.

`./iscreepchee.sh install`
