# fedora-postinstall

This script was written to help me reinstall all my utilities, tools and programs plus their respective configs on the computers I have access to.

It detects if it is being executed on a Linux machine(personal computer) or a MacOS machine(42 School computer) and runs components accordingly(ie. if on a 42 computer, doesn't run any sudo commands or Linux specific scripts).

To run this script, use:

- `./run.sh`
